# Community Challenges

The intention with community challenges is to incentivise the creation of "building blocks" in the form of reusable libraries, utilities and code snippets. This should reduce the effort required for others in the community to build personal and business projects.

Challenge acceptors create open source software by completing community challenges, get featured on our Gitlab and Youtube and win cool prizes üëæ üí™üèÜ 

*Contact Ben on [email](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/command-center/-/issues/new) or [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T8CRG18UC/D8D0JTUBE) if you have questions.*

## Submit a challenge

- *Challenges should drive acceptors to create code that is reusable by the rest of the community.*

## Accept a challenge

## Open challenges

These are challenges that are open to challenge acceptors i.e. **you!** Grab 'em while they're hot ;)

| Problem | Challenge | Use Cases |
| - | - | - |
| As a user, I am hesitant to share my transaction data with app developers. | Create a JavaScript function that anonymises transaction data and sends the data to a centralised DB.| I can use the code script in my Programmable Banking IDE to share my data while keeping anonymity. |
| As a user, I am sensitive about sharing my data for machine learning purposes. | `Epic challenge` Build a [federated learning](https://federated.withgoogle.com/) app that can be used by the rest of the community to train an AI on transaction data, while keeping a client anonymous. | I can download an app that shares the learning data from my transactions while keeping my actual data and identity abstracted and anonymous, respectively. |
| As a user, it's hard to keep track of my daily allowance. | `Special challenge` Create code for a [magic mirror](https://youtu.be/BR_yko0gr-Y) that displays your spending habits and gives you advice based on those habits. | I can setup a magic mirror in my house so that I can easily be reminded of my current spending allowance. |
| As a dev, I can't get timestamps from the Open API. | Create a library that merges times from card transactions with transactions from the Open API to give exact (where possible) and estimate timestamps to transactions. | I can use the library to enrich transaction data that comes back from the API. |
| As a dev, I can't get a notification when a transaction happens on my account. | Build a notification system that checks an account via the API to find new transactions every minute. Also, create a webhook mechanism to push new transactions to another service.  | I can now set up actions to take place whenever a transaction occurs on my accounts. |
| As a Ruby dev, I am hesitant to build an app due to the setup costs. | Build an Open API Ruby Wrapper | I'm much less hesitant to build awesome apps because there's a great Ruby wrapper for the API! |
| As a Python dev, I am hesitant to build an app due to the setup costs. | Build an Open API Python Wrapper | I'm much less hesitant to build awesome apps because there's a great Python wrapper for the API! |
| As a Go dev, I am hesitant to build an app due to the setup costs. | Build an Open API Go Wrapper | I'm much less hesitant to build awesome apps because there's a great Go wrapper for the API! |
| As a user, I think Facebook is evil, so I'd like to be able to "chat" with my bank account via Telegram to find out information about my spending habits // As a dev, I'd like to easily be able to enable "conversations" between users and their accounts.  | Telegram chatbot that sends transactions as well as tooling to manage a conversation with the user. | I can now chat with my bank account using Telegram to find out information about my spending, woohoo! / I can easily create programmable banking Telegram chat apps, woohoo! |
| As a user, I think Mark Zuckerberg is basically a cuddly teddy, and I'd like to be able to "chat" with my bank account via WhatsApp to find out information about my spending habits // As a dev, I'd like to easily be able to enable "conversations" between users and their accounts.  | WhatsApp chatbot that sends transactions as well as tooling to manage a conversation with the user. | I can now chat with my bank account using WhatsApp to find out information about my spending, woohoo! / I can easily create programmable banking Telegram chat apps, woohoo! |
| As a user, I can't go full Minority report with my bank account. | Create an augmented reality app so that a user can engage with their bank account in 3d virtual space. | As a user, I'm inside the computer! |
| As a user, I don't want to interact with my bank account/budget through a screen. | Build a reusable voice module that can be used to build a watch app / Google Home app that allows you to issue the commands. | As a user I can ask my voice assistant: Categorize transaction just made. What was my last transaction? Give me a list of recent transactions, or transactions on a specific day. What was my last payment made to merchant? value/category/when. When was my last payment to merchant? |

## FAQs
**Can multiple people/teams work on the same challenge?**
Generally a challenge will be awarded to one person or team at a time, but that doesn't stop teams from combining forces. We will try keep it to one solution per challenge though.

**What is an epic challenge?**
An `epic challenge` is harder and therefore earns you the option to win epic challenge prizes. A `special challenge` unlocks specific/special prizes. See prize descriptions for epic and special prizes.

**May I work in a team on a challenge?**
Yes, challenge acceptors may work in teams. You will need to share prizes.

**How long do I have to complete a challenge?**
Your team has 14 days to complete the challenge.

**How is the quality of the code evaluated?**
At a minimum your code must run and be reusable by another member of the community. You must submit simple steps to set up your code. We'll be improving the evaluation criteria over time.
