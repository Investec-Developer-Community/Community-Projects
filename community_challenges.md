# Community Challenges

The intention with community challenges is to incentivise the creation of "building blocks" in the form of reusable libraries, utilities and code snippets. This should reduce the effort required for others in the community to build personal and business projects.

Challenge acceptors create open source software by completing community challenges, get featured on our Gitlab and Youtube and win cool prizes üëæ üí™üèÜ

## FAQs
**Can multiple people/teams work on the same challenge?**
Generally a challenge will be awarded to one person or team at a time, but that doesn't stop teams from combining forces. We will try keep it to one solution per challenge though.

**What is an epic challenge?**
An `epic challenge` is harder and therefore earns you the option to win epic challenge prizes. A `special challenge` unlocks specific/special prizes. See prize descriptions for epic and special prizes.

**May I work in a team on a challenge?**
Yes, challenge acceptors may work in teams. You will need to share prizes.

**How long do I have to complete a challenge?**
Your team has 14 days to complete the challenge.

**How is the quality of the code evaluated?**
At a minimum your code must run and be reusable by another member of the community. You must submit simple steps to set up your code. We'll be improving the evaluation criteria over time.
