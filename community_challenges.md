# Community Challenges

Our intention and plan is to create reusable libraries, utilities and code snippets that reduce the barriers for others in the community to build useful products for themselves, their communities and their companies/employers.

Challenge acceptors create open source software by completing community challenges, get featured on our Gitlab and Youtube and win cool prizes üëæ üí™üèÜ 

*Contact Ben on [email](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/command-center/-/issues/new) or [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T8CRG18UC/D8D0JTUBE) if you have questions.*

## Submit a challenge

- *Challenges should drive acceptors to create code that is reusable by the rest of the community.*

## FAQs
**What is an epic challenge?**
An `epic challenge` is harder and therefore earns you the option to win epic challenge prizes. A `special challenge` unlocks specific/special prizes. See prize descriptions for epic and special prizes.

**May I work in a team on a challenge?**
Yes, challenge acceptors may work in teams. You will need to share prizes.

**How long do I have to complete a challenge?**
Your team has 14 days to complete the challenge.

**How is the quality of the code evaluated?**
At a minimum your code must run and be reusable by another member of the community. You must submit simple steps to set up your code. We'll be improving the evaluation criteria over time.
