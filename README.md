# Programmable Banking Command Center Challenge

[ðŸ‘‰ Jump to Community Project Demos](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/command-center#command-center-deployments)

##  Welcome

For this challenge we will be each be creating our own `Programmable Banking Command Center` to be able to do useful things with the card transaction data.

### Command Center Components

We'll build our Command Centers out of components that can be replaced or extended. This approach should promote borrowing open-source ideas from each other. Below is the current component layout: up for reconfiguration and debate!

## Challenge

### Basic Goals

Setting up your command center: to build momentum, we recommend doing the least amount of effort to get through steps 1-3 and then iterate through them.

1. Store your transactions in a DB of some kind
2. Create a view for your transactions i.e. app, chat or web-page
3. Create a GitLab Tutorial for setting up your Command Center. See the [Starter Challenge example](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/programmable-card-starter-challenge).

### Stretch Goals
Once your basic setup is running nicely, you'll start deplyoying your Command Center's capabilities :)

1. Add ability to write to your DB from your Frontend e.g. categorising transactions necessary/luxury, mine/not mine...
2. Create a realtime budget interface i.e. "You've spent X on luxury this month."

## Command Center Deployments
Projects built by the community and demo'd at the weekly Beta Community Founder Get Together.

| [Investec Oracle](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo/investec-command-center)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/tnpsjOFbkco?t=295)| What it does: The goal was to create a decentralised API to handle incoming beforeTransaction and afterTransaction requests before storing the data. This allows you to execute logic prior to storing the data and before validating transactions. Why create it? The main goal was to allow for validation logic on a transaction based on externally defined criteria, eg: limit daily spend, limit per transaction spend etc. Also, this provided an authenticated basecamp on which to build logic.  | *Laravel, Firestore, Auth0, Twilio WhatsApp chatbot* |*[@bezchristo](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo)*|

| [Decentralised API](repolink)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/LrnBHsY55uA?t=636)| What it does: Routes data through cloud functions to Google pub/sub, to which I can add multiple subscriptions for different applications. Why create it? To serve as a base for all transactions to flow through and to which different applications can connect to to receive transaction data. I also wanted to have the ability to replay transactions, which Google pub/sub provides and make it easy for other users to be able to spin up their own command center with a few clicks. | *Google Cloud Platform, Laravel* |*[@cwbmuller](https://gitlab.com/cwbmuller)*|
