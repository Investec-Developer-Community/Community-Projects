# Open Source Projects

This is an index of open source code and demos of apps and systems built by the Programmable Banking Dev Community.

`Let's make Open Banking a reality by building, sharing reusable software and connecting!`

If you're looking for something to build, or want to challenge the community to build something. The intention with [community challenges](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/command-center/-/blob/master/community_challenges.md) is to incentivise the creation of "building blocks" in the form of reusable libraries, utilities and code snippets. This should reduce the effort required for others in the community to build personal and business projects.

|[WATCH: Toshigotchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEVJDwFvO_s)||[Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TmDkEkm6mM5yEW_A91EzmFRzayzupH9th3WGVQBLnIE/edit) - What it is: Create an emotional connection to your spending habits. Money is a very emotionally charged topic and there we should be ways to make it more personable & relatable so we can react better to various financial circumstances.||@jacousteau|
|[WATCH: Paper Budget](https://youtu.be/DKV-4M4a6CE?t=1)|[<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/o0s176D.png" width="200">](https://github.com/ferdis/ynab-sync)| [Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11mcO96L9E6iWscG9ycO_Gy4wc90PY6E5N7SPrOjMhL8/edit#slide=id.g7757fe7c3f_0_105): What it does: Sync transactions to YNAB budget and categorize them. Why create it? Keep budget up to date without manual intervention. | *Starlette, React and SQLite* |@ferdis|
|[WATCH: Investec Query Bot](https://youtu.be/DKV-4M4a6CE?t=559) |[<img src = "https://github.com/lebomorojele/investecbot/raw/master/example.gif" width="200">](https://github.com/lebomorojele/investecbot)| What it does: It takes a user’s input, defines their intent, extracts queryable information, and generates a query to the DB. Eg. Show me all my transactions in Cape Town above 400 during June. Why create it? I was unsure of what to do with the card data, so figured why not let the user decide what they want to do with it. | *Swift UI (iOS), Ngrok, RASA NLP/U, SQLAlchemy, Python* |@lebo0|
|[WATCH: Programmable Banking Rule (PBR)](https://youtu.be/aqZotFl9fQw?t=1859)|[<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/rmifZuh.png" width="200">](https://gitlab.com/HagashenNaidu/programmable-banking-rules)| What it does: Allows the creation of rules that can be used at present for accepting/declining a transaction. Why create it?  Most banking apps only allow hard limits to be set on spend. The idea with this is to put the account holder in charge of the rules of the card.. | *.Net Core, Blazor WebAssembly, Warewolf, Sql DB* |@HagashenNaidu|
|[WATCH: InvestecCMD](https://youtu.be/aqZotFl9fQw?t=669)|| What it does: Sync transactions to Firestore as they come in. From Firestone, you can view you transactions in the iOS app as well as details of the transactions. You will also receive pushes when transactions are approved to the iOS App. Why create it? Great opportunity to learn how the Investec APIs works & to cut my teeth on a bunch of new techs I been dying to play with: firebase, cloud functions. typescript.. | *Native iOS, Swift, Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions)* |@WarrenFoxley|
|[WATCH: Decentralised API](https://youtu.be/LrnBHsY55uA?t=636)|| What it does: The goal was to create a decentralised API to handle incoming beforeTransaction and afterTransaction requests before storing the data. This allows you to execute logic prior to storing the data and before validating transactions. Why create it? The main goal was to allow for validation logic on a transaction based on externally defined criteria, eg: limit daily spend, limit per transaction spend etc. Also, this provided an authenticated basecamp on which to build logic. | *Google Cloud Platform, Laravel* |@cwbmuller|
|[WATCH: HankApp](https://youtu.be/3tYfpc_rjvU?t=1202)|| Hank is banking done right. Imagine a world where banking is an intuitive pleasure. It's our mission to make that world a reality. As banks open up their API's we aim to unlock their utility for the people. | *Flutter, Firebase* |*[@Chris.Fraser](https://gitlab.com/Chris.Fraser)*|
|[WATCH: Investec Oracle](https://youtu.be/tnpsjOFbkco?t=295)|[<img src = "https://gitlab.com/bezchristo/investec-command-center/-/raw/master/Investec.jpg" width="200">](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo/investec-command-center)| What it does: Routes data through cloud functions to Google pub/sub, to which I can add multiple subscriptions for different applications. Why create it? To serve as a base for all transactions to flow through and to which different applications can connect to to receive transaction data. I also wanted to have the ability to replay transactions, which Google pub/sub provides and make it easy for other users to be able to spin up their own command center with a few clicks.  | *Google Cloud Platform (Cloud functions, pub/sub, Firestore), Twillio, React, Zapper* |*[@bezchristo](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo)*|
|[WATCH: Purple Pigger](https://youtu.be/5xiRrJbblc8?t=2841)|| Linked to the beforeTransaction function, PP checks all transactions (for now) and approves or declines them, to help you control budgets in certain periods. Keeping those wild nights, not too wild. I keep a mental count of my daily spending and how it affects my budget. Now I can get a machine to do it. Basically I'm lazy!. | *Firebase, Svelte* |*[@kamogelo.sebopelo](https://gitlab.com/kamogelo.sebopelo)*|
