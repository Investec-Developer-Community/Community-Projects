# Programmable Banking Command Center Challenge

[ðŸ‘‰ Jump to Community Project Demos](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/command-center#command-center-deployments)

##  Welcome

For this challenge we will be each be creating our own `Programmable Banking Command Center` to be able to do useful things with the card transaction data.

### Command Center Components

We'll build our Command Centers out of components that can be replaced or extended. This approach should promote borrowing open-source ideas from each other. Below is the current component layout: up for reconfiguration and debate!

## Challenge

### Basic Goals

Setting up your command center: to build momentum, we recommend doing the least amount of effort to get through steps 1-3 and then iterate through them.

1. Store your transactions in a DB of some kind
2. Create a view for your transactions i.e. app, chat or web-page
3. Create a GitLab Tutorial for setting up your Command Center. See the [Starter Challenge example](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/programmable-card-starter-challenge).

### Stretch Goals
Once your basic setup is running nicely, you'll start deplyoying your Command Center's capabilities :)

1. Add ability to write to your DB from your Frontend e.g. categorising transactions necessary/luxury, mine/not mine...
2. Create a realtime budget interface i.e. "You've spent X on luxury this month."

## Command Center Deployments
Projects built by the community and demo'd at the weekly Beta Community Founder Get Together.

| [Investec Oracle](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo/investec-command-center)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/tnpsjOFbkco?t=295)| What it does: The goal was to create a decentralised API to handle incoming beforeTransaction and afterTransaction requests before storing the data. This allows you to execute logic prior to storing the data and before validating transactions. Why create it? The main goal was to allow for validation logic on a transaction based on externally defined criteria, eg: limit daily spend, limit per transaction spend etc. Also, this provided an authenticated basecamp on which to build logic.  | *Google Cloud Platform (Cloud functions, pub/sub, Firestore), Twillio, React, Zapper* |*[@bezchristo](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo)*|

| [Decentralised API](repolink)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/LrnBHsY55uA?t=636)| What it does: Routes data through cloud functions to Google pub/sub, to which I can add multiple subscriptions for different applications. Why create it? To serve as a base for all transactions to flow through and to which different applications can connect to to receive transaction data. I also wanted to have the ability to replay transactions, which Google pub/sub provides and make it easy for other users to be able to spin up their own command center with a few clicks. | *Google Cloud Platform, Laravel* |*[@cwbmuller](https://gitlab.com/cwbmuller)*|
| [InvestecCMD](repolink)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/aqZotFl9fQw?t=669)| What it does: Sync transactions to Firestore as they come in. From Firestone, you can view you transactions in the iOS app as well as details of the transactions. You will also receive pushes when transactions are approved to the iOS App. Why create it? Great opportunity to learn how the Investec APIs works & to cut my teeth on a bunch of new techs I been dying to play with: firebase, cloud functions. typescript.. | *Native iOS, Swift, Firebase (Firestore, Cloud Functions)* |*[@WarrenFoxley](https://gitlab.com/WarrenFoxley)*|
| [Programmable Banking Rule (PBR)](repolink)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/aqZotFl9fQw?t=1859)| What it does: Allows the creation of rules that can be used at present for accepting/declining a transaction. Why create it?  Most banking apps only allow hard limits to be set on spend. The idea with this is to put the account holder in charge of the rules of the card.. | *.Net Core, Blazor WebAssembly, Warewolf, Sql DB* |*[@HagashenNaidu](https://gitlab.com/HagashenNaidu)*|
| [Investec Query Bot](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CWsEj7uf2529mm2qDhH4BpckhALFIalXhcDvr4L_x74/edit#slide=id.g7757fe7c3f_0_105)|[<img src = "/images/youtube_logo.png">](https://youtu.be/DKV-4M4a6CE?t=559) | What it does: It takes a userâ€™s input, defines their intent, extracts queryable information, and generates a query to the DB. Eg. Show me all my transactions in Cape Town above 400 during June. Why create it? I was unsure of what to do with the card data, so figured why not let the user decide what they want to do with it. | *Swift UI (iOS), Ngrok, RASA NLP/U, SQLAlchemy, Python* |*[@lebo0](https://gitlab.com/lebo0)*|
