# Programmable Banking Command Center Challenge

##  Welcome

For this challenge we will be creating a "Programmable Banking Command Center" that each of you can use to do useful things with your programmable banking card transactions.

### Command Center Components

We'll be building our Command Centers out of components that can be replaced or extended. This approach should promote borrowing open-source ideas from each other. Below is the current component layout: up for reconfiguration and debate!

## Challenge

### Basic Goals

Setting up your command center. We'd recommend doing a super basic MVP of this and then loop through the process again as you go, just so we can start getting projects contributed and generate a sense of progress.

1. Store your transactions in a DB of some kind
2. Create a view for your transactions i.e. app, chat or web-page
3. Create a GitLab Tutorial for setting up your Command Center. See the [Starter Challenge example](https://gitlab.com/offerzen-beta-community/investec-programmable-banking/programmable-card-starter-challenge).

### Stretch Goals
Deplyoying your Command Center's abilities :)

1. Add ability to write to your DB from your Frontend e.g. categorising transactions necessary/luxury, mine/not mine...
2. Create a realtime budget interface i.e. "You've spent X on luxury this month."

## Command Center Deployments
TBD! Here are specific deployments of command centers built by community members.There will be surprise rewards for contributors :)
