# Command Center

##  Welcome

For this challenge we will be creating a "Command Center" that each of you can use to do useful things with your programmable banking card transactions.

## Challenge

### Basic Goals
Setting up your command center.

1. Store your transactions in a DB of some kind
2. Create a view for your transactions i.e. app, chat or web-page
3. Document and share to setup *your* command center.

### Stretch Goals
Deplyoying your command centers abilities :)

1. Add ability to write to your DB e.g. necessary/luxury, mine/not mine...
2. Create a realtime budget interface i.e. "You've spent X on luxury this month."
