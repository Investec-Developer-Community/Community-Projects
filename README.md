##  Welcome

For this challenge we will be creating a "Programmable Banking Command Center" that each of you can use to do useful things with your programmable banking card transactions.

### Command Center Components

We'll be building our Command Centers out of a components so that individual components can be switched out or extended. This is a great approach for collaborating with and stealing open-source ideas from others in the community.

Here is the current component layout: up for reconfiguration and debate!

## Challenge

### Basic Goals
Setting up your command center.

1. Store your transactions in a DB of some kind
2. Create a view for your transactions i.e. app, chat or web-page
3. Document and share to setup *your* command center.

### Stretch Goals
Deplyoying your command centers abilities :)

1. Add ability to write to your DB e.g. necessary/luxury, mine/not mine...
2. Create a realtime budget interface i.e. "You've spent X on luxury this month."

## Command Center Deployments
TBD! Here are specific deployments of command centers built by community members.

There will be surprise rewards for contributors :)
