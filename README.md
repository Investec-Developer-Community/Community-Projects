I was unsure of what to do with the card data, so figured why not let the user decide what they want to do with it. | *Swift UI (iOS), Ngrok, RASA NLP/U, SQLAlchemy, Python* |@lebo0|

From Firestone, you can view you transactions in the iOS app as well as details of the transactions. You will also receive pushes when transactions are approved to the iOS App. Why create it?

|[WATCH: Decentralised API](https://youtu.be/LrnBHsY55uA?t=636)|| What it does: The goal was to create a decentralised API to handle incoming beforeTransaction and afterTransaction requests before storing the data. This allows you to execute logic prior to storing the data and before validating transactions. Why create it? The main goal was to allow for validation logic on a transaction based on externally defined criteria, eg: limit daily spend, limit per transaction spend etc. Also, this provided an authenticated basecamp on which to build logic. | *Google Cloud Platform, Laravel* |@cwbmuller|

|[WATCH: Investec Oracle](https://youtu.be/tnpsjOFbkco?t=295)| | What it does: Routes data through cloud functions to Google pub/sub, to which I can add multiple subscriptions for different applications.

I also wanted to have the ability to replay transactions, which Google pub/sub provides and make it easy for other users to be able to spin up their own command center with a few clicks.  | *Google Cloud Platform (Cloud functions, pub/sub, Firestore), Twillio, React, Zapper* |*[@bezchristo](https://gitlab.com/bezchristo)*|
